/**
 * The producer-consumer problem (also known as the bounded-buffer problem) is a classic example of a multi-process synchronization problem.
 * The problem describes two processes, the producer and the consumer, which share a common, fixed-size buffer used as a queue.
 *
 * The producerâ€™s job is to generate data, put it into the buffer, and start again.
 * At the same time, the consumer is consuming the data (i.e. removing it from the buffer), one piece at a time.
