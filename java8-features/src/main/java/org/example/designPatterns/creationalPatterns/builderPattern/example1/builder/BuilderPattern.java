/**
 * Using a builder pattern, we can create a complex object by creating step by step using the correct sequence of actions.
 *
 * In this example, I created User with firstName as a mandatory field and other fields are considered as optional.
 * So, the normal process for creating these kinds of objects can create by implementing different constructors with different parameters,
 *      but then we need more constructors for that, and it will be not suitable for objects which have large attribute sets.
 *      Or even we donâ€™t need to use several setter methods on the created object.
 *
 * To solve this kind of problem we can use the builder class which helps in building desired User instances
 * with all mandatory attributes and a combination of optional attributes.
